# IDAProject

In this project I analyze the World University Rankings for the year of 2020 by Times Higher Education magazine. 
The World University Ranking features almost 1400 universities across 92 countries worldwide, standing as the largest and most diverse university rankings ever to date. 

The data set is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/joeshamen/world-university-rankings-2020

Note: As for the Data visualisation part I used complicated visualisation libraries. Therefore, some graphs are not visible through git.
